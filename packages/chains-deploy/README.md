# Chains Deploy

Owl Protocol's on-chain deployment script for various key smart contracts:

* Arachnid CREATE2 Deterministic Deployer
* Owl Protocol CREATE2 Factory (for more advanced deploys)
* ERC4337 Bundler & Paymaster
* EIP2535 Diamond Smart Contracts

More coming soon...

## Purpose

The key goal is to have 1 script that provides consistent deployment across EVM chains & uses counterfactual addresses whenver possible to have identical addresses on all blockchain networks.
