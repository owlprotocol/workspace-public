# Using Owl

You have two options to interact with our platform: **the Dashboard** and **the API.**

- Get started with the dashboard: [🚀 Getting Started](doc:getting-started-1)

# The Dashboard

The Dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to manage your project's Web3 digital assets, plug-in-play templates, visualize data, and edit custom details. With the Dashboard, you can:

- Deploy and manage smart contracts
- Mint, transfer, and burn tokens
- Customize token parameters and metadata
- Monitor transaction history and analytics
- Integrate with third-party services using plug-in-play templates

# The API

We also offer a comprehensive API to integrate directly into your applications and automate various tasks.

## To get started with the API:

The API provides endpoints for:
