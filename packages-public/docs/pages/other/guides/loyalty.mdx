# Deploying a Loyalty Program with Owl API

Deploying a loyalty program with Owl Protocol is an organized process that enables you to reward users with unique loyalty cards based on their activity. Follow these seven steps to set up and manage a customized loyalty program efficiently.

## Step 1: Deploy a Loyalty Program

Initiate your loyalty program deployment with the Owl API. This program allows you to mint multiple loyalty cards, each with its own points that can be updated over time. The loyalty program includes predefined tiers, and users progress through these tiers based on their accumulated points.

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@owlprotocol/contracts-api-client-trpc";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

// API_URL is optional
const { API_KEY, API_URL, NETWORK_ID } = process.env;

// Create TRPC Client (API_KEY required)
if (!API_KEY) throw new Error(`API_KEY ${API_KEY}! Get API_KEY by signing up and adding it to .env file`);

const client = createClient({ apiKey: API_KEY }, API_URL);
const networkId = NETWORK_ID ?? "80001";

// Deploy an Owl Loyalty Program
const loyaltyProgram = await client.loyalty.deploy.mutate({
    networkId,
    name: "My Loyalty Program",
    symbol: "MY",
    txWait: 1,
});
```

## Step 2: Update Default Tier Metadata

The default tier is the starting point for all users. Modify the metadata of this tier to give it a distinct identity. In this example, we set the metadata for the "Bronze" tier.

```typescript
// Update default tier
const loyaltyProgramId = loyaltyProgram.loyaltyProgramId;

await client.loyalty.tiers.update.mutate({
    loyaltyProgramId,
    tierId: "defaultTier",
    metadata: {
        name: "Bronze Tier",
        description: "This is Bronze Tier",
        attributes: [{ trait_type: "Tier", value: "Bronze" }],
    },
});
```

## Step 3: Create Additional Tiers

Expand your loyalty program by creating additional tiers. Users progress from one tier to another based on their points. Here, we create a "Silver" tier with a points threshold of 5.

```typescript
// Create a Silver tier
await client.loyalty.tiers.create.mutate({
    loyaltyProgramId,
    tierId: "silver",
    metadata: {
        name: "Silver Tier",
        description: "This is Silver Tier",
        attributes: [{ trait_type: "Tier", value: "Silver" }],
    },
    pointsThreshold: 5,
});
```

## Step 4: Mint Loyalty Cards

Create loyalty cards for users by assigning a unique card (token) to an address. This token will be used to retrieve metadata and update points.

```typescript
// Mint a loyalty card
const account = "0x1234000000000000000000000000000000000001";
const address = loyaltyProgram.contractAddress;

const mint = await client.loyalty.mint.mutate({
    loyaltyProgramId,
    addresses: [account],
    txWait: 1,
});
```

## Step 5: Retrieve Loyalty Card Metadata

Retrieve the metadata for a loyalty card, including tier information and current points. This metadata is what users will see in their wallets or on marketplaces like OpenSea.

```typescript
// Get loyalty card metadata
const { tokenId } = mint.mints[0];
const initialMetadata = await client.loyalty.metadataToken.query({ loyaltyProgramId, tokenId });
console.log({ initialMetadata });
```

## Step 6: Add Points to Loyalty Card

Update a user's points by adding a specified amount. In this example, we add five points to the user's loyalty card.

```typescript
// Add points to loyalty card
const { points } = await client.loyalty.points.add.mutate({ loyaltyProgramId, tokenId, points: 5 });
console.log({ points });
```

## Step 7: Retrieve Updated Loyalty Card Metadata

After adding points, retrieve the updated metadata to reflect the user's new tier and points.

```typescript
// Get updated loyalty card metadata, with new tier
const updatedMetadata = await client.loyalty.metadataToken.query({ loyaltyProgramId, tokenId });
console.log({ updatedMetadata });
```

Embark on this journey to deploy a loyalty program, reward users, and witness their progression through tiers with Owl API.
