# Web2 Plugins (Zapier)
Integrating Zapier with Owl Protocol opens up a world of possibilities for **Hybrid Decentralized Applications.** Hybrid Decentralized Applications **expand traditional business use cases** with the web3 benefits of decentralization, interoperability, and user ownership.

## Zapier

Zapier is a powerful automation platform that lets connect different services without coding. Create automated workflows, called **Zaps**, that consist of **triggers** (events that start a Zap) and **actions** (tasks performed by a Zap).

Use the **Owl Protocol Zapier App** to quickly connect your DApp to **existing web platforms** such as Google Forms, Eventbrite, or Shopify. Over 6000 integrations are supported by Zapier, so the sky is the limit!

## Features

The [Owl Protocol Zapier App](https://zapier.com/apps/owl-protocol-ca19902/integrations) enables a wide range of possibilities for creating Hybrid Decentralized Applications.

### Create User Wallets
If your Zap trigger collects an email, you can quickly **create a Social Login Wallet** for them. This is a great way to seamlessly onboard your user onto your DApp. You can also easily mint digital assets (eg. NFTs, tokens) to your user.

### Mint Digital Assets
Automate the minting of digital assets (eg. NFTs, tokens) based on Zapier triggers. For example, a Shopify purchase can **mint on-chain loyalty points** to the customer's wallet.

### Manage Metadata
Keep your NFT metadata (eg. image, attributes) up-to-date by using Zapier to sync data from other apps automatically. For example, **images can be synced** from a Google Drive folder to your NFT Collection, updating whenever you makes changes.

### Database Integrations
Connect popular web2 databases such as PostgresSQL, Firebase, or Airtable. This is particularly useful if you're looking to **incrementally add web3 features** to your **existing application.** For example, you can **sync your PostgreSQL database** to create wallets for users or mint NFT gaming assets.
