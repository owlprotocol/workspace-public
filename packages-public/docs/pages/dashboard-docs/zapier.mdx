# Zapier Integration

Automate actions with Zapier and Owl Protocol.

## What Is Zapier?

Zapier is an automation platform that links your apps and services, enabling the creation of "Zaps." These workflows automate repetitive tasks through triggers and actions, streamlining processes and saving time. For a deeper understanding, read [this detailed article on Zapier's key concepts](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496181725453-Learn-key-concepts-in-Zapier#01H8C8M007K6JTQYNV97BV3ED3).

## Minting NFTs From New Google Forms Responses

In this guide, you'll learn how to use the Owl App within Zapier to automate processes. Specifically, we'll set up a workflow to mint an NFT automatically whenever someone completes your Google Form.

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, create and activate a Google Form. Use this form to trigger the automation.

### Minting NFTs from new Google Forms responses

<Steps>

### Sign-in/Sign-up

Create an account on Zapier using [this link](https://zapier.com/sign-up). If you already have an account, sign in.

### Use our Template

We have created a simple Zapier template for this guide. Click [here](https://zapier.com/app/editor/template/1741724) to get set up quickly.

Upon clicking this link, you should see something like this:

import start from "../../public/assets/zapier/start.png";

<Screenshot src={start} alt="start" />

### Configure the Google Trigger

Click on `New Form Response in Google Forms` to configure the trigger.

Set the event to `New Form Response`.

import googleEvent from "../../public/assets/zapier/googleEvent.png";

### Collection Page

<Screenshot src={googleEvent} alt="googleEvent" />

Sign in with the Google account that you used to create the Google Form in the account section.

import googleAccount from "../../public/assets/zapier/googleAccount.png";

<Screenshot src={googleAccount} alt="googleAccount" />

Configure the trigger. To proceed, ensure you have previously created and published a Google Form. In this example, we are using a pre-created form named 'Concert X'. If you haven't created and published a form, no options will appear.

import googleTrigger from "../../public/assets/zapier/googleTrigger.png";

<Screenshot src={googleTrigger} alt="googleTrigger" />

### Configure the Owl Action

Set the event to `Mint ERC721`.

import owlEvent from "../../public/assets/zapier/owlEvent.png";

<Screenshot src={owlEvent} alt="owlEvent" />

Connect to your Owl Account. Paste an API Key in the modal that pops up. Create/Find your API Key [here](/dashboard-docs/get-api-key).

<Callout type="warning">
  **Managing Zapier Accounts**

When creating multiple Zaps, avoid using the same account for all of them. Instead, **connect new accounts** with different API Keys for different projects. Additionally, you can **rename the connections** to match your project names, rather than using the default 'Owl Protocol' name. This helps in easily identifying which account and API Key belong to which project.

</Callout>

import owlAccount from "../../public/assets/zapier/owlAccount.png";

<Screenshot src={owlAccount} alt="owlAccount" />

### Fill in the Action Fields

-   For **Collection Address**, if you have already deployed a collection, you will see the names and addresses of these collections once you click the input.If not, first [deploy a collection](/dashboard-docs/deploy-collection).
-   For the **to** field, use the Respondent Email output from the Google Form. This way, tokens will be sent to anyone who submits the form.
-   Just like for Collection Address, if you have previously created Templates, they will appear in the **Token Template ID** input field. If not, you don't need a template for this.

import owlAction from "../../public/assets/zapier/owlAction.png";

<Screenshot src={owlAction} alt="owlAction" />

You can also customize the assets you are minting to your users. Give them a name, an image, and some attributes. These fields are all optional.

import owlAction2 from "../../public/assets/zapier/owlAction2.png";

<Screenshot src={owlAction2} alt="owlAction2" />

After testing the trigger, publish your Zap. Your screen displays something like this:

import success from "../../public/assets/zapier/success.png";

<Screenshot src={success} alt="success" />

While it is turned on, you will mint an ERC721 from the selected collection to every user who completes your form.

</Steps>

### Workflow Recap

By following this guide, you have successfully set up an automated workflow that mints NFTs whenever someone completes your Google Form. This integration saves time and ensures immediate reward distribution, enhancing user engagement and automating the NFT minting process.

### Additional Tips

-   **Troubleshooting:** If your Google Form responses are not triggering the Zap, double-check that the form is properly published and accessible.
-   **Customization:** Fill in fields such as name, image, and attributes to personalize the NFTs. You can also create Templates in the Owl App to further customize the NFTs to meet your specific needs.

### Next Steps

Explore the wide range of apps available on Zapier and experiment with Owl Protocol. Develop your own workflows to meet your specific needs, and discover creative ways to automate and enhance your Web3 experience.
