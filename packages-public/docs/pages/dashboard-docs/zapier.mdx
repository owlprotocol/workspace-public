# Zapier Integration

Automate actions with Zapier and Owl Protocol

## What is Zapier?

Zapier is a powerful automation platform that enables you to connect and integrate different apps and services without coding. It allows you to create automated workflows, called "Zaps," that consists of triggers (events that start a Zap) and actions (tasks performed by a Zap). With Zapier, you can automate repetitive tasks, streamline your workflows, and save valuable time.

<Steps>

In the Overview section of your project page ([Owl Dashboard](https://dashboard.owlprotocol.xyz/)), you can see your project users and your collections. Click on `Create Collection`.

import createCollectionButton from "../../public/assets/createCollectionButton.png";

<Screenshot src={createCollectionButton} alt="createCollectionButton" />

### Collection Modal

When the modal appears, input a name and a symbol, and upload an image. Once you've checked your entries, click on `Create Collection`.

import collectionModal from "../../public/assets/collectionModal.png";

<Screenshot src={collectionModal} alt="collectionModal" />

### Collection Details

Creating the collection may take a few seconds. Once the deployment is complete, it will appear in the "Collections" section. By clicking on `View Details`, you will be directed to the collection's page with more information about the collection you just deployed.

import ViewDetailsButton from "../../public/assets/ViewDetailsButton.png";

<Screenshot src={ViewDetailsButton} alt="ViewDetailsButton" />

## Collection Page

On the "Collection" page, you'll find your collection name, image, and contract address.

The collectibles that you mint will appear under "Digital Items". Any item types that you define will be listed under "Item Types". (See [âž• Create an Item Type & Mint to Users](doc:mint-from-item-type))

import CollectionViewEmpty from "../../public/assets/CollectionViewEmpty.png";

<Screenshot src={CollectionViewEmpty} alt="CollectionViewEmpty" />
