# Steps

<Steps>

### Sign Up
Go to our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.owlprotocol.xyz/), and sign up.

### Create A Team

Teams allow multiple users to manage projects. Pick a name for your new team. Note that the slug is generated from the name. You will be able to change the name later but not the slug.

import createTeam from "../../public/assets/createTeam.png";

### Deploy Demo Project

Now, click on the `Demo Project` button, and select `Gaming Collectibles`. Notice that there is another demo project you can try out.

import createProjectButtons from "../../public/assets/createProjectButtons.png";

<Image src={createProjectButtons} alt="createProjectButtons" height={65} />

import demoProjectTypeSelect from "../../public/assets/demoProjectTypeSelect.png";

<Screenshot src={demoProjectTypeSelect} alt="demoProjectTypeSelect" />

</Steps>

# Further Steps

There you have it: your first (demo) project!

Notice the table of users at the bottom of the project overview. These are demo users, but any users you add would appear here. You can mint assets to any of them.

Notice too the table of collections. One is already deployed for you in the demo project, but you would be expected to deploy your own in custom projects.

You can now [Get Your Project API Key](/dashboard-docs/get-api-key), and either continue the Dashboard tutorial, our check out API tutorial.
