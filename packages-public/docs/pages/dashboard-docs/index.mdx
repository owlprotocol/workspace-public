# Owl Protcol

Welcome to **Owl Protocol**, a developer platform that simplifies the creation and management of digital assets across the EVM ecosystem while serving as a bridge between Web2 and Web3. With straightforward APIs and built-in support for platforms like Zapier, we empower developers to effortlessly integrate digital tokens (ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155) into traditional backend services and thousands of interconnected applications.

Our Web3 APIs are as easy to use as any traditional web API, and our no-code dashboard makes project management simple, even for non-technical team members. Owl provides a streamlined, all-in-one solution, eliminating the need to manage multiple tools.

-   **For Developers and Enterprises:** Save time, reduce development costs, and browse extensive documentation and examples to get you started. Our platform scales with your needs, accommodating solo developers and large enterprises alike.
-   **For Your Users:** Better experience, enhancing engagement through social logins, gas sponsorship and wallet abstraction. Users can interact with your Web3 applications without needing in-depth knowledge, simplifying the onboarding.

## Owl FAQ

The Owl FAQ is a collection of useful questions and answers about the
project. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please
[open a discussion](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/discussions).

export function FAQBox({ title, children }) {
    return (
        <details
            open
            className="last-of-type:mb-0 rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2 mt-4"
        >
            <summary>
                <strong className="text-lg">{title}</strong>
            </summary>
            <div className="nx-p-2">{children}</div>
        </details>
    );
}

<FAQBox title="Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?">
    No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for
    the app router has not been implemented yet. But you can use `/app` and
    `/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your
    other routes in `/app`
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
  The answer is “yes” for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
  that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

-   [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
-   [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
-   [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?">
    There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
    [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
    add live coding components to your MDX.
