# Project Overview

## Create Collection

In the Overview section of your project page ([Owl Dashboard](https://dashboard.owlprotocol.xyz/)), you can see your project users and your collections. Click on `Create Collection`.


## Collection Modal

When the modal appears, input a name and a symbol, and upload an image. Once you've checked your entries, click on `Create Collection`.

## Collection Details

Creating the collection may take a few seconds. Once the deployment is complete, it will appear in the "Collections" section.  By clicking on `View Details`, you will be directed to the collection's page with more information about the collection you just deployed.


# Collection Page

On the "Collection" page, you'll find your collection name, image, and contract address.

The collectibles that you mint will appear under "Digital Items". Any item types that you define will be listed under "Item Types". (See [âž• Create an Item Type & Mint to Users](doc:mint-from-item-type))
