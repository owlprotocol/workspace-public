# Overview

Owl Protocol empowers developers to create feature-rich, user-friendly Web3 applications that can reach mainstream adoption. Our modular infrastructure simplifies the complexity of interacting with smart contracts, reducing development time and costs and enabling developers to build, launch, and scale DApps with ease.

Owl Protocol's core is our Contracts API, offering extensive endpoints for managing smart contracts without requiring Solidity expertise. Our platform includes integrated wallets, an Account Abstraction API (ERC4337), plug-and-play integrations, a no-code dashboard, and advanced contract architecture support through EIP2535 Diamonds.

Additional tools and services surround our core infrastructure, making it easier and cheaper for developers to create, launch, and maintain DApps. Our integrated wallets combine MPC and social logins, while our Account Abstraction API supports popular implementations, bundlers, gas sponsorships, and user ops utility functions.
