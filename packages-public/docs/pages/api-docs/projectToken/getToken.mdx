	chainId: 130130
	address: "0xD7bA09F9787Aa6FF2c41B16c557Ff20d0D2901cB",
  tokenId: "2"
})
```

**Required fields**:

-   `chainId`: Id of the chain you selected when creating your project.
-   `address`: Address of the collection from which the token was minted.
-   `tokenId`: Id of the token (pass it as a string, not a number).
