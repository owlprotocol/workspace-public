# No Code Dashboard
Owl Protocol Dashboard is the hub that let's you quickly manage your Decentralized Application. Using the dashboard, you can quickly **launch and configure smart contracts**, manage metadata, view analytics, and collaborate with other team members.

## Features

### No Code Smart Contracts
Use the Owl Protocol Dashboard to quickly deploy and configure smart contracts. Owl Protocol Dashboard & API work seamlessly together. The dashboard can deploy and iteract with the **same contracts** that the API can. You can for example deploy an NFT from the dashboard and mint it from the API or vice-versa.
