Welcome to Owl, a developer platform that simplifies the creation and management of digital assets across the EVM ecosystem while serving as a bridge between Web2 and Web3. With straightforward APIs and built-in support for platforms like Zapier, we empower developers to effortlessly integrate digital tokens (ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155) into traditional backend services and thousands of interconnected applications.

Our Web3 APIs are as easy to use as any traditional web API, and our no-code dashboard makes project management simple, even for non-technical team members. Owl provides a streamlined, all-in-one solution, eliminating the need to manage multiple tools.

- **For Developers and Enterprises:** Save time, reduce development costs, and browse extensive documentation and examples to get you started. Our platform scales with your needs, accommodating solo developers and large enterprises alike.
- **For Your Users:** Better experience, enhancing engagement through social logins, gas sponsorship and wallet abstraction. Users can interact with your Web3 applications without needing in-depth knowledge, simplifying the onboarding.

# Features

## 1\. ERC Standards, Modular and Upgradable Smart Contracts

Our infrastructure can auto-deploy core pieces of smart contract infrastructure onto any EVM and custom chains. With our architecture, adding new functionality, such as a mint mechanism for an e-commerce plugin, is as simple as sending a REST API call. You can add your own logic behind the scenes, and the mint, burn, transfer, and render logic of our smart contracts are upgradeable. You maintain full control over what's enabled since you own the deployed smart contracts.

1. Smart Contract Standards: ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155
   1. Easily deploy and manage your contracts utilizing our intuitive API endpoints with the ability to update parameters and configuration as needed.
   2. Mint, burn, and transfer tokens with dedicated endpoints, providing a seamless and efficient token management experience.
   3. Token Allowlist Management: Manage users restrictions, such as limiting token transfer/mint to certain users and wallets.
2. Manage NFT Metadata: Update contract parameters, such as base_uri, and access powerful tools for managing NFT media assets and their associated metadata. Our infrastructure simplifies the process of updating and maintaining accurate NFT metadata.
3. Upgradable and Modular Diamond Contracts (EIP2535): Manage the logic of pointing to facets (aka implementations) and upgrading your smart contracts. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability as your project evolves.

## 2\. Smart Wallets Built-In

 Each API key comes with a secure MPC (Multi-Party Compute) key pair that you can use to deploy our Smart Wallet on any EVM chain. The wallet has flexible permissions and no vendor lock-in, in case you want to switch to your own private key solution.

- For developers: A fast, easy, and secure way to start your project and manage transactions. Our Smart Wallet solution simplifies the development process and provides a secure foundation for managing transactions.
- For users: Better user experience. Users don't need to save wallet credentials, acquire fast native tokens, or display confirmation popups when unnecessary

## 3\. Gas Sponsorship

Simplifying transactions fees. All our API endpoints automatically handle the gas fees and bill you at the end of the cycle. No need to worry about running out of crypto, or funding your users' wallets.

## 4\. Team-Based Project Management

Easily collaborate with your team on a project, its assets, and its users. Add collaborators to your organization, and they will have access to the necessary resources.

## 5\. 6000+ App Integrations

With built-in Zapier integration, you can create numerous workflows and trigger on-chain events with the 6000+ apps marketplace. Connect to e-commerce platforms, Point of Sale (PoS) systems, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, spreadsheets, and more.
