# Getting Started

Get started with Owl Protocol by setting up your development environment with this tutorial.

**Prerequisite**: Create a team and project in [the Owl Protocol Dashboard](https://dashboard.owlprotocol.xyz/).

<Callout type="warning">
  **API Key**

The API Key is crucial for authenticating your requests to Owl Protocol. <span style={{ color: "red" }}>**Never expose your API Key in the frontend or client-side code**</span>. Always keep it secure and use it only in **server-side** code to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security of your project.

</Callout>

<Steps>
### Get Your Project API Key
Go to our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.owlprotocol.xyz/), select a team and a project.

On the project overview, you will see the API key under the project name and description.

You can click the copy button to copy the API key to your clipboard, or display the full key by clicking on the eye icon.

import projectApiKey from "../public/assets/projectApiKey.png";

### Install Client Library

**Install the SDK**.
Use the following command to install the necessary library:

```bash
pnpm install @owlprotocol/core-trpc
```

### Configute Environment Variables

**Configure Your Environment**:
Set up and load your environment variables to initialize the Owl Protocol client. This involves creating a `.env` file in your project directory and adding your Project API key.

    - Create a `.env` file and include the following line:

```
API_KEY_SECRET=your_project_api_key_here
```

    - Use the code snippet below to load the `.env` file:

```typescript
import dotenv from "dotenv";

// Load environment variables from .env file
dotenv.config();

const { API_KEY_SECRET } = process.env;

// Validate the presence of the API key
if (!API_KEY_SECRET) {
    throw new Error(
        "API_KEY_SECRET not found! Ensure it's correctly set in your .env file."
    );
}
```

### Create client

Create the client with your API key using the following command:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@owlprotocol/core-trpc";

// Initialize the Owl Protocol client with your API key
const client = createClient({ apiKey: API_KEY_SECRET });
```

</Steps>

Congratulations on setting up your development environment for Owl Protocol! Remember, you'll need to follow these steps to configure the environment for any new project where you use Owl Protocol.

You are now ready to start building and experimenting with Web3 applications. Happy coding!
