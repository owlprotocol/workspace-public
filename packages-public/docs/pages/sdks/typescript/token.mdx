# Get Project Token

Get information about a specific token. This will also return the metadata associated to the token.

```typescript
const token = client.projectToken.get.query({
	chainId: 130130
	address: "0xD7bA09F9787Aa6FF2c41B16c557Ff20d0D2901cB",
  tokenId: "2"
})
```

**Required fields**:

- `chainId`:  Id of the chain you selected when creating your project.
- `address`: Address of the collection from which the token was minted.
- `tokenId`: Id of the token (pass it as a string, not a number).

**Optional fields**: See [Get project token](ref:projecttoken-get)

# Patch Project Token

Modify certain fields for a token, while keeping the other previously defined fields intact.

```typescript
client.projectToken.patch.mutate({
	chainId: 130130,
  address: "0xD7bA09F9787Aa6FF2c41B16c557Ff20d0D2901cB",
  tokenId: "2",
  metadata: {
    name: "Updated Token Name",
  }
})
```

**Required fields**:

- `chainId`:  Id of the chain you selected when creating your project.
- `address`: Address of the collection from which the token was minted.
- `tokenId`:  Id of the token (pass it as a string, not a number).
- At least one of the metadata fields (`name`,`description`, etc...)

**Optional fields**: See [Patch project token](ref:projecttoken-patch)
