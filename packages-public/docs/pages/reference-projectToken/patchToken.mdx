# Patch Project Token

Modify certain fields for a token, while keeping the other previously defined fields intact.

```typescript
client.projectToken.patch.mutate({
    chainId: 130130,
    address: "0xD7bA09F9787Aa6FF2c41B16c557Ff20d0D2901cB",
    tokenId: "2",
    metadata: {
        name: "Updated Token Name",
    },
});
```

**Required fields**:

-   `chainId`: Id of the chain you selected when creating your project.
-   `address`: Address of the collection from which the token was minted.
-   `tokenId`: Id of the token (pass it as a string, not a number).
-   At least one of the metadata fields (`name`,`description`, etc...)

**Optional fields**: See [Patch project token](https://docs-api.owlprotocol.xyz/reference/projecttoken-patch)
