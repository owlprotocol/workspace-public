## 2\. Smart Wallets Built-In

Each API key comes with a secure MPC (Multi-Party Compute) key pair that you can use to deploy our Smart Wallet on any EVM chain. The wallet has flexible permissions and no vendor lock-in, in case you want to switch to your own private key solution.

-   For developers: A fast, easy, and secure way to start your project and manage transactions. Our Smart Wallet solution simplifies the development process and provides a secure foundation for managing transactions.
-   For users: Better user experience. Users don't need to save wallet credentials, acquire fast native tokens, or display confirmation popups when unnecessary

## 3\. Gas Sponsorship

Simplifying transactions fees. All our API endpoints automatically handle the gas fees and bill you at the end of the cycle. No need to worry about running out of crypto, or funding your users' wallets.
