# Owl Protcol

Welcome to **Owl Protocol**, a developer platform that simplifies the creation and management of digital assets across the EVM ecosystem while serving as a bridge between Web2 and Web3. With straightforward APIs and built-in support for platforms like Zapier, we empower developers to effortlessly integrate digital tokens (ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155) into traditional backend services and thousands of interconnected applications.

Our Web3 APIs are as easy to use as any traditional web API, and our no-code dashboard makes project management simple, even for non-technical team members. Owl provides a streamlined, all-in-one solution, eliminating the need to manage multiple tools.

-   **For Developers and Enterprises:** Save time, reduce development costs, and browse extensive documentation and examples to get you started. Our platform scales with your needs, accommodating solo developers and large enterprises alike.
-   **For Your Users:** Better experience, enhancing engagement through social logins, gas sponsorship and wallet abstraction. Users can interact with your Web3 applications without needing in-depth knowledge, simplifying the onboarding.
