# Quickstart

Get started with Owl Protocol in **1min** by a digital asset and sending it to our CEO with just an email! This quickstart uses `curl` commands in the terminal to keep things simple. You can then move on our other tutorials that use our SDKs.

<Steps>
### Get Your API Key

Go to [owl.build](https://owl.build) to get your API Key. If this is your first time signing up, you will automatically have a default team (**My Team**) and a default project (**My Project**).

import projectApiKey from "../public/assets/projectApiKey.png";

<Screenshot src={projectApiKey} alt="projectApiKey" />

The next couple steps will simply be run in your terminal. First temporarily make your api key an environment variable to make it easier for the next couple commands. Run this in your terminal.

```bash copy showLineNumbers
export API_KEY=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx # Replace Here
```

<Callout type="warning" >

**API Key**

<span style={{ color: "red" }}>
    **Never expose your API Key in the frontend or client-side code.**
</span>
Your API Key is crucial for authenticating your requests to Owl Protocol. Always
keep it secure and use it only in **server-side** code to prevent unauthorized access
and ensure the security of your project.
<br />

</Callout>

### Launch a collection

Deploy a new ERC721 collection using the Owl Protocol API.

```bash copy showLineNumbers
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.owl.build/api/project/collection/deploy \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --header "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
    --data '{ "chainId": 150150, "name": "My Collection", "symbol": "MYC" }'
```

You should a response like this. **Make sure to copy** the `contractAddress` for the next step.

```json
{
    "contractAddress": "0x687F4aFbDF5dC6DfeE92CE6580917e8cd27e3bd9",
    "userOpHash": "0xa4cec609adc748eb6af7940919f57b49d51d7709c2b66612f99374a1b4cda630",
    "contractUri": "https://api.owl.build/api/metadata-contract/150150/0x687F4aFbDF5dC6DfeE92CE6580917e8cd27e3bd9",
    "name": "My Collection",
    "symbol": "MYC",
    "baseUri": "https://api.owl.build/api/metadata-token/150150/0x687F4aFbDF5dC6DfeE92CE6580917e8cd27e3bd9/",
    "royaltyReceiver": "0x06A5B18BE656327463404a83955D3964e3becCbc",
    "feeNumerator": "500",
    "deployParams": {
        "salt": "0xd984e1473498b33cfb7f5097d764d8511f03e8faa359680032a2bf37c88a1588"
    }
}
```

Copy the `contractAddress` and export it for future use.

```bash copy showLineNumbers
export ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 #Replace here
```

### Mint digital asset to user

Mint a digitial asset to the user. Provide the collection address, recipient's email, and optional asset metadata (such as name, description, and image).

```bash copy showLineNumbers
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.owl.build/api/project/collection/150150/$ADDRESS/mint-batch/erc721AutoId \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --header "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
    --data '{ "to": ["leo@owlprotocol.xyz"], "metadata": {"name": "NFT #1", "description": "This was so easy!", "image": "https://picsum.photos/200" } }'
```

You should a response like this

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "NFT #1",
        "description": "This was so easy!",
        "image": "https://picsum.photos/200"
    },
    "userOpHash": "0x9cfb50d991af323e8a085a1b837a0be75971bb445e0a9738c0188a68805e45d9",
    "tokens": [
        { "to": "0x6D9882BA693eaF28dcBD23f8629DAD98eE140BE9", "tokenId": "1" }
    ]
}
```

You can also view the nft you deployed on the block explorer. Note that indexing metadata might take a while but you should quickly see that an ERC721 digital asset was created on the blockchain.

```bash showLineNumbers
echo "View NFT at https://explorer-testnet.hedwig.build/token/$ADDRESS"
```
