# Add Project Users

A project user enables you to create and link a smart wallet to an email address. This allows you, for example, to mint an asset to someone only using an email. This is done by creating both a DFNS wallet and a Smart wallet. The DFNS wallet is the only owner of the Smart wallet. The Smart Wallet enables gasless transactions.

For more information about our wallet structure, see [Smart Wallets Built-In](https://docs-api.owlprotocol.xyz/docs/introduction#2-smart-wallets-built-in)

<Steps>
### Create users

On the Project Overview page, click on `Add Users`.

import AddUsersButton from "../../public/assets/AddUsersButton.png";

<Screenshot src={AddUsersButton} alt="AddUsersButton" />

Fill out the form with your user's email. Optionally, you can also include their full name and external ID. Once this is done, click on `Add User`.

import AddModal from "../../public/assets/AddModal.png";

<Screenshot src={AddModal} alt="AddModal" />

You're now ready to create the user. Before finalizing the process, consider adding more users through one of the following two methods:

-   `Add Another User`: Continue adding users manually, as demonstrated earlier.
-   `Import CSV`: If you have multiple users to add, consider importing them from a CSV file. Use our sample CSV to ensure the data is properly formatted and readable.

import ImportCSV from "../../public/assets/ImportCSV.png";

#### Add users with CSV

To add users with CSV, you need to have the following three columns in your file: "email", "fullName", "externalId". See the example table below:

| email             | fullName  | externalId |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :--------- |
| `marc@gmail.com`  | Marc Doe  | 12345      |
| `alice@gmail.com` | Alice Doe | 67890      |

### Confirm adding

Click `Create Users` to finalize your changes. After confirming, the users will be added to the project.

import createUsers from "../../public/assets/createUsers.png";

<Screenshot src={createUsers} alt="createUsers" />

### View Users

The newly added users will appear in your users table. This addition simplifies the minting process. Each user has a wallet address to which you can mint collectibles.

import usersTable from "../../public/assets/usersTable.png";
