# Mint an Asset to a User

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to seamlessly mint an asset to a user using Owl Protocol. Along the way, we'll also cover how to deploy collections and add users to your project.

**Minting assets is particularly useful for airdrops, giveaways, or any promotional campaign designed to deliver unique assets directly to your users.**

<Steps>
### Tutorials Repository
<Callout>
    The tutorials repository contains a basic `index.ts` file to follow along tutorials as well as the final code of all Owl Protocol tutorials under the `/tutorials` folder.
</Callout>

#### Clone the repo

We have created the Owl Protocol [tutorials repository](https://github.com/owlprotocol/tutorials.git) to quickly get started. It comes set up with Typescript, viem, permissionless, and Owl Protocol SDKs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owlprotocol/tutorials.git owlprotocol-tutorials
cd owlprotocol-tutorials
```

Now, let's install the dependencies (we recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))

```sh npm2yarn
npm install
```

The main file we will be working with is `index.ts`. Let's run it to make sure everything is working

```sh npm2yarn
npm start
```

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see something similar to this printed to the console.

```
Welcome to Owl Protocol!
API_KEY_SECRET not found! Ensure it's correctly set in your .env file.
```

To fix the error you will **need an API Key**.

#### Get Your API Key

Go to [owl.build](https://owl.build) to get your API Key. If this is your first time signing up, you will automatically have a default team (**My Team**) and a default project (**My Project**).

Copy the API key to your clipboard and paste it into the `.env` file in the tutorial template repository. This should **silence the error** when you run `pnpm start` and only show `"Welcome to Owl Protocol!"`.

<Callout type="warning">
  **API Key**

<span style={{ color: "red" }}>
    **Never expose your API Key in the frontend or client-side code.**
</span>
Your API Key is crucial for authenticating your requests to Owl Protocol. Always
keep it secure and use it only in **server-side** code to prevent unauthorized access
and ensure the security of your project.

</Callout>

### Create TRPC Client

Create the client with your API key using the following command:

```ts copy showLineNumbers
import { createClient } from "@owlprotocol/core-trpc/client";

// Initialize the Owl Protocol client with your API key
const client = createClient({ apiKey: API_KEY_SECRET });
```

### Add users to your project

To mint an asset for a user, first add the user to your project using the `createOrSet` method:

```ts copy showLineNumbers
/***** Create a user *****/
const user = await client.projectUser.createOrSet.mutate({
    email: "leo@owlprotocol.xyz", //Owl Protocol CEO (Send me something cool!)
});
```

To retrieve an existing user by email, you can use `get` method:

```typescript
/***** Get a user ******/
const userExisting = await client.projectUser.get.query({
    chainId: 150150, //this won't be required soon
    email: "leo@owlprotocol.xyz",
});
console.debug(
    `User ${userExisting.email} has smart account ${userExisting.safeAddress}`
);
```

### Launch a collection

Deploy a new ERC721 collection using the client, or use one of your existing collections.

Set the name and symbol of your collection, and any other optional parameters.

```ts copy showLineNumbers
/***** Launch a collection *****/
// The id of the blockchain we wish to connect to, replace this with any
// chainId supported by Owl Protocol.
const chainId = 150150;
const contract = await client.collection.deploy.mutate({
    name: "My Collection",
    symbol: "MYC",
    chainId,
    // Add other optional parameters
});
```

### Mint digital asset to user

Call `collection.erc721AutoId.mint` to mint an asset to the user. Provide the collection address, recipient's email, and optional asset metadata (such as name, description, and image).

```ts copy showLineNumbers
/***** Mint Asset to User *****/
const image = "https://picsum.photos/200"; // Replace with your image. Make sure the image is properly hosted online.

await client.collection.erc721AutoId.mintBatch.mutate({
    chainId,
    address: contract.contractAddress,
    to: [user.email],
    metadata: {
        name: "NFT #1",
        description: "This was so easy!",
        image,
    },
});
```

</Steps>

### Summary

Using the Owl Protocol API & tRPC client, you have:

-   Deployed an ERC721 digital asset collection
-   Minted a digital asset to a user using just an email

Under the hood however, you've also leveraged several additional features implicitly:

-   Used Owl Protocol's Wallet API to create wallets
-   Used Owl Protocol's Account Abstraction API to sponsor transactions

To learn more about these advanced low-level APIs, check out the [Gasless Transactions](../tutorials-account-abstraction/gasless-transactions.mdx) tutorial.
