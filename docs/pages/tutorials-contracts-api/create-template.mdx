# Create a Template

In this section, you will learn about templates, what they are, and how to create and modify them.

<Callout type="info">
  ðŸ“˜ **Templates**

A template contains metadata, including an image, a name, and attributes, adhering to the [OpenSea Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards). This feature streamlines the minting process, allowing you to mint multiple items using the same predefined metadata.

**Templates are useful for defining metadata for tokens, especially when you anticipate minting multiple items with the same attributes, such as name and image. Create a template to simplify the minting process by using predefined metadata, which avoids the need to manually input details for each item.**

<Steps>

### Set Up Your Development Environment

Follow our [Set Up Your Development Environment](/api-docs/development-environment) tutorial to ensure your development environment is properly set up.

### Create a Template

We will use the `projectTokenTemplate.createOrSet` method from the `client` object. Ensure you have set up and authenticated the `client` object.

Launch a collection before proceeding. If you haven't or don't know how to, check out the [Launch a Collection](/api-docs/mint-asset-to-user#launch-a-collection) step from our previous tutorial.

You can follow this tutorial without a collection by defining a template for your project as a whole. However, associating templates with specific collections helps keep your project organized and is particularly useful in some cases, like when using [Zapier](/dashboard-docs/zapier).

```typescript
let image = "https://picsum.photos/200"; // Replace this with your image URL.

const template = await client.projectTokenTemplate.createOrSet.mutate({
    address: contract.address, // Optionally, include the address of your collection to ensure the template is specific to a collection, not just the project.
    metadata: {
        name: "Example",
        description: "Your description here",
        image,
    },
});
```

You have now created a template associated with the collection (contract) by passing the address here.

### Modify a Template

Modify your existing templates at any time by calling the `projectTokenTemplate.patch` method. In this example, we modify the description while keeping the previously set fields (name and image) the same.

```typescript
const modifiedTemplate = await client.projectTokenTemplate.patch.mutate({
    id: template.id, // use the template we created above.
    metadata: {
        description: "New Token Description", // Replace description with this one
    },
});
```

### Mint an asset to user

Now, use this template to mint an item to a user with the predefined metadata.

```typescript
await client.collection.erc721AutoId.mintBatch.mutate({
    address: contract.address,
    to: ["userEmail@example.com"],
    projectTokenTemplateId: modifiedTemplate.id, // pass template ID here
});
```

</Steps>

Congratulations on creating your first template. This template remains available for future minting operations. Create templates for any item you plan to mint frequently. For example, if you are creating a video game and plan to mint many 'Piece of Wood' items, you can keep minting using the template, avoiding the need to reset the image and fields each time

**Next steps?**

-   **Test the Template:** Ensure the template works as expected by minting a few tokens. Verify that all metadata fields (name, description, image, etc.) correctly apply to the minted tokens.

-   **Create Additional Templates:** Create additional templates for different types of assets you plan to mint based on your project requirements. This approach saves time and ensures consistency across your tokens.

-   **Integrate with Other Tools:** Integrate your templates with automation tools like Zapier to streamline your workflow. Check out the [Zapier Integration Guide](/dashboard-docs/zapier) for more details.

Follow these next steps to maximize the potential of your templates and create a more efficient and effective token minting process.
