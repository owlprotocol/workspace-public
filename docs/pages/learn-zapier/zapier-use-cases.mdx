# Use Cases
Owl Protocol Zapier App makes it trivial to **add web2 connectivity** to your Decentralized App. Various use cases can quickly be launched with **limited coding** necessary.

### Airdrops & Mints
<Callout>
If you are looking to build a **more advanced use case** using Zapier (eg. Ticketing, E-Commerce) we **strongly recommend** trying out the **Google Forms Tutorial** first to get a feel for using Owl Protocol with Zapier.
</Callout>
Mint tokens or NFTs from Google Form submissions or Google Sheets data. Use this to reward community members or create personalized NFTs.

        href="/tutorials-zapier/google-sheet"
    />
</Cards>


### Event Ticketing
Integrate with platforms like Eventbrite to mint NFTs for new attendee check-ins. Each ticket purchase or event registration can trigger creating and distributing a unique NFT.

### Database Sync
<Callout type="warning">
If your database is quite large, you can prototype a simple MVP using Zapier, but you should consider using the [Owl Protocol API](../learn-api.mdx) directly for your use case
</Callout>

**Incrementally add web3 features** to your **existing application** by syncing your database models (eg. gaming server) with blockchain smart contracts. You can keep running your **existing infra** that will partially be **synced on-chain** as database entries are made.

Let's say for example you have an SQL database with in-game assets that are **not** on blockchain  but are associated with a user's email (or wallet address). You can easily add a `onchain: bool` column that when set to `TRUE` mints the asset to the user. More advanced logic can also be implemented that incorporates more values such as in-game points or stats.

### GitHub Contributions
Reward GitHub contributors with digital assets (eg. NFTs, tokens) when they contribute code or documentation to your project. This fosters a vibrant community of developers that can help you incorporate feedback into your product.
