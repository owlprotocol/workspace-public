# Gasless Transactions
In this tutorial, you will submit your first fully-gasless transaction from a smart account using the Owl Protocol [ERC4337](https://www.erc4337.io/docs) Account Abstraction API and [permissionless](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless).

You will set up the necessary permissionless clients, create a [user operation](https://www.erc4337.io/docs/understanding-ERC-4337/user-operation) (aka ERC4337 transaction), ask the Owl Protocol verifying paymaster to sponsor it, and then submit it on-chain with the Owl Protocol bundler.

<Steps>

### Clone The Repo
<Callout>
    The [tutorials repository](https://github.com/owlprotocol/tutorials.git) contains a basic `index.ts` file to follow along tutorials as well as the final code of all Owl Protocol tutorials under the `/tutorials` folder.
</Callout>


We have created the Owl Protocol [tutorials repository](https://github.com/owlprotocol/tutorials.git) to get you started quickly. It comes set up with Typescript, viem, permissionless, and Owl Protocol SDKs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owlprotocol/tutorials.git owlprotocol-tutorials
cd owlprotocol-tutorials
```

Now, let's install the dependencies (we recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))

```sh npm2yarn
npm install
```

The main file we will be working with is `index.ts`. Let's run it to make sure everything is working

```sh npm2yarn
npm start
```

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see something similar to this printed to the console.
```
Welcome to Owl Protocol!
API_KEY_SECRET not found! Ensure it's correctly set in your .env file.
```

To fix the error you will **need an API Key**.

### Get Your API Key
<Callout type="warning">
  **API Key**

<span style={{ color: "red" }}>**Never expose your API Key in the frontend or client-side code.**</span>
Your API Key is crucial for authenticating your requests to Owl Protocol. Always keep it secure and use it only in **server-side** code to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security of your project.

</Callout>
Go to [owl.build](https://owl.build) to get your API Key. If this is your first time signing up, you will automatically have a default team (**My Team**) and a default project (**My Project**).

Copy the API key to your clipboard and paste it into the `.env` file in the tutorial template repository. This should **silence the error** when you run `pnpm start` and only show `"Welcome to Owl Protocol!"`.

### Create The Public, Paymaster, Bundler Clients
<Callout type="info">
    **Clients** provide access to sets of actions using the [viem](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/intro) library. For example, a **public** client provides access to readable data such as transactions and blocks.
</Callout>

To send gasless transactions using ERC4337 Account Abstraction, we will need **3 important clients**:
*  The [public client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public) will be responsible for **querying the blockchain**
*  The [paymaster client](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/clients/pimlicoPaymasterClient) will be responsible for interacting with the Owl Protocol verifying paymaster endpoint to **request sponsorship** of user operations
* The [bundler client](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/clients/bundlerClient) will be responsible for the last step of finally **submitting user operations**

Let's open up `index.ts`, and add the following to the bottom

```ts
/***** Create Clients *****/
// The id of the blockchain we wish to connect to, replace this with any
// chainId supported by Owl Protocol.
// Here we use the Hedwig Testnet for quick testing
const chain = {
    chainId: 150150,
    slug: "hedwig-testnet",
    name: "Hedwig Testnet",
    testnet: true,
    nativeCurrency: {
        decimals: 18,
        name: 'Ether',
        symbol: 'ETH',
    },
    rpcUrls: {
        default: {
            http: ["https://rpc-hedwig-testnet-6uuksiwu6t.t.conduit.xyz"],
            webSocket: ["wss://rpc-hedwig-testnet-6uuksiwu6t.t.conduit.xyz"],
        },
    },
};
const chainId = 150150;
const blockExplorer = "https://explorer-testnet.hedwig.build"

// Create public viem client to read data from blockchain
// Learn more at https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
    transport: http(`https://api.owl.build/${chainId}/rpc?apikey=${API_KEY_SECRET}`),
})

// Create paymaster viem client to sponsor UserOp
// Learn more at https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/clients/pimlicoPaymasterClient
const paymasterUrl = `https://api.owl.build/${chainId}/rpc?apikey=${API_KEY_SECRET}`
const paymasterClient = createPimlicoPaymasterClient({
    transport: http(paymasterUrl),
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
})

// Create bundler viem client to submit UserOp
// Learn more at https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/clients/bundlerClient
const bundlerUrl = `https://api.owl.build/${chainId}/rpc?apikey=${API_KEY_SECRET}`
const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
    transport: http(bundlerUrl),
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
})
```

### Create The Smart Wallet
<Callout type="info">
    To learn more about different types of wallets check out [Wallets](../learn-wallets.mdx)
</Callout>

For the purposes of this guide, we will be using [Simple Account](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol) as a smart wallet implementation. This is an ERC4337 wallet controlled by a single owner (eg. Metamask, Owl Developer Wallet).

#### Create Smart Wallet Owner
In this tutorial, we'll simply use a private key as the owner.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`
```ts
/***** Create Smart Wallet Owner *****/
// Load private key from .env or generate a new one (and save it)
// Warning: Do NOT use such logic in production, for tutorial purposes ONLY
const privateKey =
    (process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as Hex) ??
    (() => {
        const pk = generatePrivateKey()
        writeFileSync(".env", `API_KEY_SECRET=${API_KEY_SECRET}\nPRIVATE_KEY=${pk}`)
        return pk
    })()

// Owner of the smart account
const owner = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey)
```


#### Create Smart Account
<Callout type="info">
    A **Smart Account** mimics the interface of a viem [Account](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/custom) but also extends it with smart wallet specific info such as how to sign (but not send) ERC4337 user operations.
</Callout>

We now create a **Smart Account**. Use [signerToSimpleSmartAccount](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/accounts/signerToSimpleSmartAccount) from permissionless. We need to specify the `factoryAddress` we are using as well as the global ERC4337 `entryPoint` address. For the `signer`, we use the `owner` we just created.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`

```ts
/***** Create Smart Account *****/
// Simple smart account owned by signer
const smartAccount = await signerToSimpleSmartAccount(publicClient, {
    signer: owner,
    factoryAddress: 0xe7A78BA9be87103C317a66EF78e6085BD74Dd538, //Simple Smart Account factory
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
})

console.log(`Smart account address: ${blockExplorer}/address/${smartAccount.address}`)
```

Let's run this code with `npm start`. You should see the smart account address printed to the console.

```txt
Smart account address: https://explorer-testnet.hedwig.build/address/<address>
```

<Callout>
If you visit the address on the block explorer, you might notice that no contract is actually deployed to this address yet. This is because smart accounts are counterfactual: they are only deployed on-chain the first time you send a transaction through them.
</Callout>

#### Create Smart Account Client
<Callout type="info">
    A [SmartAccountClient](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/clients/smartAccountClient) mimics the interface of a viem [Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet) but under the hood will send ERC4337 user operations whenever you call `sendTransaction` or `writeContract`
</Callout>

Now that we have a Smart Account, we can create a **Smart Account Client** to send transactions. We specify the optional `sponsorUserOperation` middleware function, calling the [sponsorUserOperation](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/pimlico-paymaster-actions/sponsorUserOperation) function from the paymaster client. This will make sure that the user operation is sponsored by the Owl Protocol verifying paymaster.

Finally, we specify the `gasPrice` middleware function to fetch the gas price using the [getUserOperationGasPrice](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/pimlico-bundler-actions/getUserOperationGasPrice) function from the bundler client that we will use to submit the user operation in the next step.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`

```ts
/***** Create Smart Account Client *****/
const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    account: smartAccount,
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
    chain,
    bundlerTransport: http(bundlerUrl),
    middleware: {
        gasPrice: async () => {
            return (await bundlerClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast
        },
        sponsorUserOperation: paymasterClient.sponsorUserOperation,
    },
})
```

### Submit A Gasless Transaction

Finally, let's submit a transaction from our smart wallet. We will send a transaction to the `0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045` (vitalik.eth) address with `0x1234` as example `callData`.

Under the hood, the Smart Account Client will build a user operation, request paymaster sponsorship, sign it with the smart wallet owner's private key, and then submit it to the bundler. The bundler will then query for receipts until it sees the user operation included on-chain.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```ts
/***** Submit Gasless Transaction *****/
const txHash = await smartAccountClient.sendTransaction({
    to: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045", // vitalik.eth
    value: 0n,
    data: "0x1234",
})

console.log(`User operation included: ${blockExplorer}/tx/${txHash}`)
```

Let's run this code again with `npm start`. This should output the transaction hash that contains the user operation.

```txt
User operation included: https://explorer-testnet.hedwig.build/tx/<hash>
```

You can now view the transaction on the blockchain explorer.

### Summary
By sending this user operation, you have:
- Deployed a counterfactual smart account contract
- Had this newly-deployed smart account verify the private key's signature
- Sponsored a user operation's gas fees with the Owl Protocol verifying paymaster
- Executed a simple transaction to `vitalik.eth`'s address

All in a couple lines of code.

Congratulations, you are now a pioneer of Account Abstraction! 🎉
