# Using The Owl Wallet

In this tutorial, you will create a basic React app that lets you connect to an Owl Protocol wallet and send a gasless transaction with a smart account using the Owl Protocol [ERC4337](https://www.erc4337.io/docs) Account Abstraction API, [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) hooks and a [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) wallet connector.

<Steps>

### Clone The Repo

We have created the Owl Protocol [tutorials-react repository](https://github.com/owlprotocol/tutorials-react.git) to get you started quickly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owlprotocol/tutorials-react.git owlprotocol-tutorials-react
cd owlprotocol-tutorials-react
```

Now, let's install the dependencies (we recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))

```sh npm2yarn
npm install
```

Then, copy the example environment variables. You do not need to change these.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The main file we will be working with is `App.tsx`. Let's run `vite` to make sure everything is working

```sh npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

### Create A Project On The Owl Dashboard

Owl Wallets are tied to a project. Head to the [Owl Dashboard](https://dashboard.owlprotocol.xyz) to create a project. Note that you can also use the default one created for you. Then, take note of the project id.

### Initialize The Owl Provider

Initialize the Owl Provider in `App.tsx` to enable the Owl Wallet and gasless transactions.

Note that this is already done for you in the starter repository.

This provider is used to interact with our API.

Make sure to also import `@owlprotocol/ui-components/style.css`. This CSS file styles Owl UI components.

```tsx
import { OwlProvider } from "@owlprotocol/ui-components";

import "./App.css";
import "@owlprotocol/ui-components/style.css";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Owl React Tutorials</h1>

      <OwlProvider>
        {/* Add tutorial snippets below */}
      </OwlProvider>
    </>
  );
};
```

### Create The Owl Wallet Test Component

In this step, we will initialize wrappers to create blockchain interactions.

We first set the Owl project id, from the environment variable `VITE_PROJECT_ID`. Make sure to set your project id inside of a `.env` file.

We will connect to the Hedwig Testnet chain, which has chain id `150150`.

We start by fetching data about that chain by making a tRPC call to the Owl API.

We then set up two providers:

-   `WagmiProvider`: enables hooks for blockchain interactions such as sending transactions

```tsx
import { trpc } from "@owlprotocol/core-trpc/react-query";
import { Chain, http } from "viem";
import { createConfig, WagmiProvider } from "wagmi";

const projectId = import.meta.env.VITE_PROJECT_ID;

if (!projectId || projectId === "PROJECT_ID")
    throw new Error("VITE_PROJECT_ID must be defined!");

export const OwlWalletTest = () => {
    const [hedwigTestnetChain] = trpc.network.get.useSuspenseQuery({
        chainId: 150150,
    });

    const chains = [hedwigTestnetChain] as readonly [Chain];

    const config = createConfig({
        chains,
        transports: {
            [hedwigTestnetChain.id]: http(hedwigTestnetChain.rpcDefault),
        },
    });

    return (
        <WagmiProvider config={config}>
            {/* We will be writing this component next */}
            <OwlWalletTestInner />
        </WagmiProvider>
    );
};
```

### Create The Owl Wallet Test Inner Component

We now create the inner component, which consists of the RainbowKit button to connect a wallet, and a button to send a transaction. We also add the `useOwlSimpleSmartAccount` hook. This automatically overrides the basic Owl wallet the users connects with to use a smart wallet.

Notice that when you send a transaction, the transaction hash will be displayed under. The `data` attribute of `useSendTransaction` gets populated once the transaction has successfully been sent.

```tsx
import { trpc } from "@owlprotocol/core-trpc/react-query";
import {
    OwlConnectButton,
    useOwlSimpleSmartAccount,
} from "@owlprotocol/ui-components";
import { Chain, http, zeroAddress } from "viem";
import {
    createConfig,
    useConnectors,
    useSendTransaction,
    WagmiProvider,
} from "wagmi";

const projectId = import.meta.env.VITE_PROJECT_ID;

if (!projectId || projectId === "PROJECT_ID")
    throw new Error("VITE_PROJECT_ID must be defined!");

export const OwlWalletTestInner = () => {
    const { sendTransaction, data: txHash } = useSendTransaction();

    const connectors = useConnectors();

    useOwlSimpleSmartAccount();

    return (
        <>
            <button
                onClick={() =>
                    sendTransaction({
                        to: zeroAddress,
                        value: 0n,
                        data: "0x",
                    })
                }
            >
                Send test transaction
            </button>
            <br />
            <br />
            {!!txHash && <p>Transaction Hash: {txHash}</p>}
            <button onClick={() => connectors.forEach((c) => c.disconnect())}>
                Disconnect All
            </button>
            <br />
            <br />
            <OwlConnectButton projectId={projectId} />
        </>
    );
};

export const OwlWalletTest = () => {
    // ...
};
```

### Add The Owl Wallet Test Component To The App

Back in `App.tsx`, import and add the `OwlWalletTest`.

```tsx
import { OwlProvider } from "@owlprotocol/ui-components";
import { OwlWalletTest } from "./tutorials/owl-wallet.jsx";

import "./App.css";
import "@owlprotocol/ui-components/style.css";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Owl React Tutorials</h1>

      <OwlProvider>
        {/* Add tutorial snippets below */}
        <OwlWalletTest />
      </OwlProvider>
    </>
  );
};
```

</Steps>

And voil√†! Run `pnpm dev` again if needed, and check out your first app with a gasless transaction. Make sure to connect your wallet, and then click on `Send Test Transaction`.
